# Learning Registry Ruby Test
* A test project to assess a software developer's skills
* This test is a form of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru scenario

## References
* Refer to: https://github.com/learningtapestry/learning-registry-ruby-tools/tree/master/extractor
* (Don't copy code code from this code base)

## Instructions
* Create a Ruby project with a private gitub repo (use Bitbucket or any free git provider)
* Use any libraries, frameworks or gems that you want
* Pull the data from LR api on server: http://node01.public.learningregistry.net/
* Normalize it as best you can into a relational structure
* Put it into a structured postgres database (not json fields)
* Expose the data via an api or html user interface
* Include a test harness and some tests
* Provide some basic documentation on how to use your project
* Limit your effort to no more than 8 hours
* Create a report of what you were unable to accomplish, and how long you think it will take to complete.

## Notes
* It is impossible to finish this job completely in 8 hours. Try to get a basic end-to-end prototype solution working. Do the best you can - your effort is what is being tested.
* You can share the project with us via the repository directly, or send us a git bundle or tar/gz file.
* If you run into trouble, ask us questions.

## Evaluation Criteria (in order of importance)
1. Does the code work? (It only needs to work on a developer's workstation)
1. Does the code have tests?
1. Is the code cleanly implemented?
1. We assume the project will not be completed entirely: Does the final report give a good summary on what work is remaining, how to solve it, and how much time it will take?
1. Is the code easy to install?
1. Is the code efficient? (Does it make inappropriate use of system resources, like consuming too much ram?)
1. Does the project code follow a consistent style? (It could look like https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide, but not required)
1. Are the SCM commits small and with good comments?
