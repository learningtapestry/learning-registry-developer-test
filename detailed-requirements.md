## Tips for passing this test

- Read this README carefully and come up with a plan to finish it as best as you can.
- Use simple frameworks instead of complicated ones.
- Ask us if you're unsure about something.
- Don't submit your project without tests. You won't have time to test everything, so choose what to test.
- It's better to accomplish only part of the project well, than to get partway done with everything.

## Detailed Requirements

- You must use the framework agreed upon between you and the hiring manager, for the web aspect of the project. You can add additional libraries and tools where needed, but it would be unreasonable (for example) to add Angular to a React framework project.
- You must write meaningful tests.
- You must follow the instructions on this page closely.
- You must version your code with git.
- All of your interfaces should use CSS for layout and style. You can use any CSS compiler, unless you are asked to use a specific one. You can use any CSS page layout framework (you should use one), unless you asked to use a specific one.    
- Your pages should be stand-alone HTML, meaning they can just be loaded into a browser locally and they will work. It's fine to use a compiler but your final work product should be stand-alone.
- Your user interface can be simple, but it should be functional and nice to look at. You aren't being tested on your graphic art skills or your UX design skills, but you are being tested on your ability to make simple, nice looking interfaces based on api data.
- Provide some basic documentation on how to use your project.
- Limit your effort to no more than 8 hours total.
- Create a final report of what you were unable to accomplish, and how long you think it will take to complete.
- Send us your repo in a [git bundle](https://git-scm.com/blog/2010/03/10/bundles.html).

## Notes
- We believe it is impossible to finish this job completely in 8 hours. Try to get a basic end-to-end prototype solution working. Do the best you can - your effort and approach are being tested. We are also trying to understand how you wrap up a project temporarily before it is fully complete.
- If you run into trouble, ask us questions by emailing your point of contact for the test. We can provide feedback on what is important to focus on, or whether a particular framework or library is allowed under the test, but we can't provide feedback or direction on work in process.
